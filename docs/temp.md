"Tell me about a project you're proud of"
"I built LetterFlux to solve a pain point I experienced - CSS clamp() is powerful but hard to visualize. I created an interactive editor that shows real-time graphs of how fluid properties behave across screen sizes."

"How do you approach performance?"
"I implemented a service worker for caching, used Vue's built-in lazy loading, and optimized the component architecture to minimize re-renders. The app loads instantly on repeat visits."

"Describe a technical challenge you solved"
"The biggest challenge was making the graph update smoothly in real-time while maintaining 60fps. I used Vue's reactivity system efficiently and debounced calculations to prevent unnecessary updates."
